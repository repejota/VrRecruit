Vreasy Task's confirmation
==========================

Introduction
------------

Welcome! We’ve created this project hoping that will help us nto getting a feeling of how you work. If anything is unclear, please do not hesitate to contact us with questions! (<mailto:mauro@vreasy.com>)

At Vreasy we work with several technologies. At the web-application level, we currently use PHP ([ZF1](https://github.com/zendframework/zf1)), [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) and a bit of [jQuery](http://jquery.com/).
We are working into moving our software into SOA approach. So we build thin json APIs and we run most of what the user sees in the client side.

You can find the briefing for this task in [The Vreasy Developer’s Quiz document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19kYCiaYKmg6AqUn2ckrFZd9VGLudOrmlcXpIZ2Vz8yQ/edit?usp=sharing)
